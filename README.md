# passman
a password manager written in rust, with strong encryption<br>
this is still in development but its finishing up now<br>
<br>
this is a password managaer written in rust and the passowrds are stored encrypted<br>
it is part of my summer of code project where i aim to do around 9 coding projects<br>
over my extended summer holidays before i head to university<br>
<br>
the passwords are stored using a binary file ".pass"<br>
you will need to create it and give some temporary data before using it<br>
the data is stored using a vernam cipher<br>
this was chosen as it is fast and computaionally secure<br>
